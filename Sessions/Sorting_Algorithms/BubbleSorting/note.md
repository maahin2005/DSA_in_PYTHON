# Bubble Sort

### Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

- Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Start at the beginning of the list.
2. Compare the first two elements. If the first is greater than the second, swap them.
3. Move to the next pair of elements and repeat the process until the end of the list.
4. The largest element will "bubble up" to its correct position at the end of the list.
5. Repeat the process for the remaining list (excluding the last sorted elements) until no more swaps are needed.

## Summary:

    - Repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements to bubble the largest unsorted element to its correct position.
    - It has a time complexity of O(n^2)

## TC: 𝑂(𝑛^2)
