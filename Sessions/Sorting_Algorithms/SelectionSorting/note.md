# Selection Sort

### Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the list into two parts: the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the end of the sorted part.

- Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Start with the first element as the minimum.
2. Traverse the rest of the list to find the smallest element.
3. Swap the smallest element with the first element.
4. Move the boundary between the sorted and unsorted parts one element to the right.
5. Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted part.

## Summary:

    - Repeatedly selects the smallest unsorted element and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
    - It has a time complexity of O(n^2)

## TC: 𝑂(𝑛^2)
