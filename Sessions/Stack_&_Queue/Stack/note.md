# Stack

## LIFO: Last in First Out

- A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out `(LIFO)` Principle.
- This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.
- Think of it like a stack of plates: you add plates to the top and also remove plates from the top.

## Operations on a Stack

### Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.

### Pop: Remove and return the top element of the stack.

### Peek: Return the top element without removing it.

### isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
