### Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. The function continues to call itself with modified arguments until it reaches a base case, which is a condition that stops the recursion.

## Key Concepts

- Base Case: The condition under which the recursion stops. Without a base case, the function would call itself indefinitely, resulting in infinite recursion.
- Recursive Case: The part of the function where the function calls itself with modified arguments.
